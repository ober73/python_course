## QUIZ ###

he output of the following code will be:

TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str		
TypeError


## Literals ##

4 types

Integers (octal 0o123) 8 to the power of these numbers

so 0o123 is 

8 to the power of 2 = 64

8 to the power of 1 = 8

8 to the power of 0 = 1

then calculate with the numbers

so 1 x 64 = 64
   2 x 8  = 16
   3 x 1  = 1
   
   so = 83

  (hexadecimal uses 16 as the base )
  0x123 
  
  16 to the power of 2 = 254
  
  16 to the power of 1 = 16
  
  16 to the power of 0 = 1
  
  then multiply to the actual values of the numbers
  
  256 x 1 = 256
  16 x 2 = 32
  1 x 3 = 3
  
  = 291
